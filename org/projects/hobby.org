Created a linux distribution on top of [[https://archlinux.org/][Arch linux]]. The distribution uses a manual tiling window manager ([[https://i3wm.org/][i3wm]]). Written various modules, scripts and programs to make the distribution lightweight and powerful at the same time.
* Software Repositories
- [[https://github.com/KanishakVaidya/kv-arch-repo][GitHub Link]]
I maintain my own repositories of softwares that I use quite often and whose pre-build binaries are unavailable.
