* Coded Compting
We considered the variation of coded computation in which a master node wants to multiply two matrices \(\mathbf{A}\) and \(\mathbf{B}_D\) where \(\mathbf{B}_D\) is a matrix in the library of matrices \(\mathcal{B}\), containing \(M\) matrices \(\{ \textbf{B}_m \}_{m = 1}^M\). The matrix \(\textbf{A}\) is exclusively owned by the master and library \(\mathcal{B}\) is exclusively shared by non-colluding workers. Master encodes \(\textbf{A}\) and sends encoded data to workers, along with queries that request them to encode the library \(\mathcal{B}\) and to perform computation on the encoded data. After master recovers \(\textbf{AB}_D\) from the returned computations, the workers must not be able to identify that \(\textbf{B}_D\) was desired by the master, i.e. master's /demand privacy/ is ensured. Also the contents of \(\textbf{A}\) is hidden from the workers, thus ensuring /data privacy/.

We proposed a scheme that simultaneously ensures
- /Resiliency/ against slow worker nodes or /stragglers/
- /Privacy of data/ from colluding workers
- /Privacy of demand/ against colluding workers and
- /Security/ against malicious (or erroneous) worker nodes.

As a motivating example consider a user who is employing AI assistant, e.g. Google Assistant on its mobile phone. The user requests a recommendation from AI assistant of an item included in one of the \(M\) categories e.g. Movies, Games, Restaurants. Data for \(m^{th}\) category is represented by the matrix \(\textbf{B}_m\) and the set of all such matrices \(\{ \textbf{B}_m \}_{m=1}^M\) is the library \(\mathcal{B}\) shared by the servers. User store its preference matrix \(\textbf{A}\) and want recommendation about category represented by \(\textbf{B}_D \in \mathcal{B}\) based on \(\textbf{A}\). For that, user encodes \(\textbf{A}\) and upload encoded data to the servers in order to compute \(f(\textbf{A} , \textbf{B}_D)\). The demand privacy of user is violated if colluding servers get to know that user wants recommendation for category represented by \(\textbf{B}_D\) and data privacy is ensured by hiding the contents of \(\textbf{A}\). System is secure if even a subset of computation returned by the servers is incorrect, the user will be able to decode true computation \(f(\textbf{A}, \textbf{B}_D)\)

Our scheme uses Reed-Solomon codes to achieve computational redundancy and trade upload and download costs for privacy and security.
